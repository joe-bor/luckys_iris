# IRIS Order Helper v1

This project simplifies the process for Department Managers at Lucky Stores Supermarket to view and edit their IRIS-recommended orders by generating barcodes for each item in their current list. Instead of hand-typing in the order codes of each item in the hand-held gun, we simply just have to scan it.
